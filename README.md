# Carousel-Table
Displaying tables in Xamarin Forms with multiple columns can be very challenging especially in portrait mode.  Users have to repeatedly scroll horizontally to view more data.  From a UI perspective not only is this cumbersome, but the impact of the data model can be lost.  This is where Carousel Table comes in.  It can dynamically display any 2 dimensional data array in a clean and precise way on any device or orientation.  The columns will be flipped vertically and the rows can be traversed through automated paging or manual scrolling.  The user will always now where they are.  A picture is worth a thousand words.
